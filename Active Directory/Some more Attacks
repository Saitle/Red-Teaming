KERBEROASTING
Kerberoasting is a common AD attack to obtain AD tickets that helps with persistence. In order for this attack to work, an adversary must have access to SPN (Service Principal Name) 
accounts such as IIS User, MSSQL, etc. The Kerberoasting attack involves requesting a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and Ticket Granting Service (TGS).

python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip MACHINE_IP THM.red/thm
python3.9 /opt/impacket/examples/GetUserSPNs.py -dc-ip MACHINE_IP THM.red/thm -request-user svc-user 
and again gotta crack em all

AS-REP Roasting
AS-REP Roasting is the technique that enables the attacker to retrieve password hashes for AD users whose account options have been set to "Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication". 
This option relies on the old Kerberos authentication protocol, which allows authentication without a password. Once we obtain the hashes, we can try to crack it offline, and finally, 4
if it is crackable, we got a password!
